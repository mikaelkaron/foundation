The above quote is one of the most popular education related quotes on the internet and there's a reason for that - its simple and goes straight to the heart of the problem and presents an obvious solution.

Open-learning was founded in 2015 by me ([Mikael Karon](http://mikael.karon.se)) and my wife [Rose Karon](http://rose.karon.se) after spending three and a half years at [EF Learning Labs](http://labs.ef.com) Shanghai. Having had a first-hand oportunity to experience the demand for learning through EF's customers and seeing just how much access to education can change the lives of people when helping to film a segment of the "Advancing Humanity" feature filmed for the [Atlassian 2013 keynote](https://summit.atlassian.com/archives/2013/general-sessions/keynote-day-one), we've grown a passion for learning.

Both of us have families that have been directly impacted by the sometimes hard choices to choose education over the more obvious choice to make money that could pay for food and shelter. Choices made not further back then a generation or two and we both understand and appreciate the difference those choices have made in our lives.

At the same time we've both failed at getting certification of higher education but still managed to reach a lot of our personal and professional goals, and in our careers we've frequently run across similar individuals, people who just wanted to do something badly enough that they sat down, learned what they needed to get good at it and some even turned their hobby into a career and a livelihood. This does not mean that higher education does not have anything to offer but simply that the key differentiator is the passion to learn combined with the tools and materials to do so.

We are however presented with a tough question when juxtaposing the profile of the dream candidate for a senior role in the tech industry with the product of a USD100K+/year education - Is it really worth it?

The certificate gets you through the door but you simply can't [stunt](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stunt) it for long in todays day and age. You *can* however eat up a lot of time and cost the company that hired you a lot of money while at the same time taking up a space that someone else who *really* knows his stuff but does'nt have the accreditation could have used.

And if your parents could have spent more quality time hanging out with you instead of saving up for that univeristy degree and all the little things needed to get you there you could have had the oportunity to discover what motivated them to become who they are and through their knowledge prepare for what life has in store for you.

In reality that's what learning is about and why we put so much weight on its importance, we all know how much difference it can make and the impact it can have on the future so we try as hard as we can to get ahead by trying to apply best-practices and go through the motion of standard education hoping that somehow it will help us meet our goals and expectations. And it's not like it can't. There are many excellent individuals out there with more diplomas from more institutions than can be mentioned here, but more often then not these individuals would have excelled with or without formal education they have and probably would have preffered to have the opportunity to learn what they have with more control of their own education.
